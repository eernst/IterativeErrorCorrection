# IterativeErrorCorrection

Iterative error correction of long Illumina reads minimizes the total amount of erroneous reads, which improves contig assembly [1]. This pipeline runs multiple rounds of k-mer-based correction with an increasing k-mer size, followed by a final round of overlap-based correction. By combining the advantages of small and large k-mers, this pipeline is able to correct more errors in repeats. The final overlap-based correction round can also correct small insertions and deletions.

The script SGA-ICE (SGA-Iteratively Correcting Errors) implements iterative error correction by using modules from the String Graph Assembler (SGA) [2]. 

# Installation
First, you need to install this source code branch of SGA, where we added a few new parameters. 
 git clone https://github.com/ktrns/sga/commits/master

Then follow the [SGA installation instructions](https://github.com/jts/sga/tree/master/src#readme)
